# LED Dog Collar
<img src="./images/main.jpg" width="700">

Here it is the 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗗𝗼𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿 **v1.0**. It took at least 5 different design approaches and about year and a half to complete this bright shining led dog collar. There are 10 colorfull patterns which can be switched by a press of a button, 11th mode cycle through each pattern every 30 sec. This project was created especially for my friend's dog called Duch (eng.Ghost).<br />
Inside of the enclosure there is a custom made PCB which is a WS2812B LED controller. Powered by 3.7v LiPo battery, ATTiny85 MCU with battery charging LED indicators and one button to controll them all. One click start the MCU, then you can switch animations by single click and long press turns off the controller. I reached out the limits of the memory of ATTiny85 so there is only 10 animations. <br />
The box was created in Fusion360. It took dozens ideas to make it work as it is now with this bending and blurring tube. At the end I decided to create a collar that is put over the dog's head as the material that diffuse leds is really stiff and unfold to the straight line. In general any clip fastening is marking collar shape not round. I would definitely look for another diffusing material for version 2.0.
